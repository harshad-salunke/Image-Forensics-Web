# FotoForensics
WebApp for Image Forensics Detection using ELA and CNN

# Project Information
This project aims to devise a method of detecting tampered images using modern AI based technologies namely Error Level Analysis(ELA) and Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) and protect against fake images and the impact that they may have on unsuspecting users.


# Methods
1. Error Level Analysis (ELA)
2. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)


# Execution
Need Python 3.9
